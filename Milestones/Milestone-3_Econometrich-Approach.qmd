# Economic model
Economic model of reference taken from the literature (e.g. if you measure impact of train delay on school grades, then it could be a theory model showing how school performance is a function of many things, and one of them is school behavior – which itself is a function of punctuality)


# Setting
How many treated and non-treated units you observe in which part of the sample period and how treatment is defined. Which is your endogenous variable and which the main outcomes?

# Mechanism
What do you think is the story that explains the relationship between your independent and dependent variables? Do you think there is a way to directly test for it? If yes, how do you plan to do it? If no, why?

# Source of Bias and Identification
Which are the potential biases and limitations of your study, what is the intuition you leverage on to build your identification strategy? If you think there is going to be a bias stemming from the setting or a data characteristic, then in which direction do you think it is?

# Formulas
State as formulas the baseline OLS/LM equation and the chosen further identification strategy specification(s).

# Identified types of effects
Which type of treatment are your results supposed to identify? Are you identifying a causal relationship? If yes, which are the identification assumptions that should hold?
