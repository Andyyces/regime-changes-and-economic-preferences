# Economic model

*Economic model of reference taken from the literature (e.g. if you measure impact of train delay on school grades, then it could be a theory model showing how school performance is a function of many things, and one of them is school behavior – which itself is a function of punctuality)*

As Detlefsen et al. [-@detlefsen_are_2024] points out, the formation of economic preferences in **childhood** and **adolescence** has a long-term consequences for life outcomes. To provide an example, patience can impact one's school performance, which can later translate to education attainment and labor market outcomes. The same way can risk preference impact one's financial decisions [@detlefsen_are_2024].

According to the National Library of Medicine, childhood is defined as a stage from **3-11 years** and adolescence as a stage from **12-18 years**[@balasundaram2025]. But what factors can have an impact on economic preferences?

# Setting

*How many treated and non-treated units you observe in which part of the sample period and how treatment is defined. Which is your endogenous variable and which the main outcomes?*

Treatment definition was one of our main tasks until now. Our goal was to capture both **sudden** and **gradual regime changes** and direction of change (democratization/autocratization) according to changes in **LDI** (Liberal Democracy Index).

We followed similar methodology as described in [@luhrmann_autocratization_2020], which is based on the evaluating differences of the LDI at time ***t*** and time ***t-10.*** Afterwards, following steps are executed:

-   Computation of standard errors and **confidence intervals** of the respective changes.If the **confidence intervals don't overlap** andthe **absolute value of the change in LDI is higher than 0.05**, the change in LDI is recognized as significant and identified as regime change.

-   If regime change in a country at time t is identified, we take a look into the gps dataset and **assign the treatment to individuals, who are between 3-18 years at the time of regime change in their country**.

# Mechanism

*What do you think is the story that explains the relationship between your independent and dependent variables? Do you think there is a way to directly test for it? If yes, how do you plan to do it? If no, why?*

# Source of Bias and Identification

*Which are the potential biases and limitations of your study, what is the intuition you leverage on to build your identification strategy? If you think there is going to be a bias stemming from the setting or a data characteristic, then in which direction do you think it is?*

# Formulas

*State as formulas the baseline OLS/LM equation and the chosen further identification strategy specification(s).*

@callaway_difference--differences_2024 :if we assume regime changes are permanent @de_chaisemartin_two-way_2020 : if we model regime changes also in reverse (treatments turn on and off)

@borusyak_revisiting_2024 :permanent regime changes

# Identified types of effects

*Which type of treatment are your results supposed to identify? Are you identifying a causal relationship? If yes, which are the identification assumptions that should hold?*

# Questions for meeting on 12.3.

-   After running the basic regression -\> effect of formative_regime_change significant but low R2

-   Regarding the methodology as described in "Setting": We are capturing democratization/autocratization as a regime change. But maybe not all democratization/autocratization process must necessarily mean the regime has changed? Should we consider another criterion which at the end evaluates if the value of LDI is: above 0.5 -\> liberal democracy, below 0.5 -\> autocracy?
