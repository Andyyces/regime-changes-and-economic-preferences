	abstract = {Democracies depend on the support of the general population, but little is known about the determinants of this support. We investigated whether support for democracy increases with the length of time spent under the system and whether preferences are thus affected by the political system. Relying on 380,000 individual-level observations from 104 countries over the years 1994 to 2013, and exploiting individual-level variation within a country and a given year in the length of time spent under democracy, we find evidence that political preferences are endogenous. For new democracies, our findings imply that popular support needs time to develop. For example, the effect of around 8.5 more years of democratic experience corresponds to the difference in support for democracy between primary and secondary education.},

Our discussion highlights the different ways that the {DiD} literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work.

The data reveal substantial heterogeneity in preferences across countries, but even larger within-country heterogeneity. Across individuals, preferences vary with age, gender, and cognitive ability, yet these relationships appear partly country specific. At the country level, the data reveal correlations between preferences and biogeographic and cultural variables, such as agricultural suitability, language structure, and religion. Variation in preferences is also correlated with economic outcomes and behaviors. Within countries and subnational regions, preferences are linked to individual savings decisions, labor market choices, and prosocial behaviors. Across countries, preferences vary with aggregate outcomes ranging from per capita income, to entrepreneurial activities, to the frequency of armed conflicts.},

As benchmarks are central to methodologies for global income comparisons over time, and therefore vital to {MPD}, we analyze the consequences and biases of three benchmarks, the 1990 benchmark, the 2011 benchmark and the multiple benchmark method following the recent Penn World Tables ({PWT}) methodology, for pre-1940 income estimates. We develop a methodology to determine which benchmark in combination with time series produces the best anchor for the historical income estimates in the {MPD}. We conclude that the best way forward for the Maddison Project is to stick to the original 1990 benchmark, yet with two important changes. First, we integrate the 2011 benchmark for the post-1990 period, and second, we fine tune the dataset for the pre-1940 period by integrating a new historical benchmark for the {US}/{UK} comparison in 1909. By integrating more benchmarks, the {MPD} moves closer to a multiple benchmark approach as developed by the {PWT}.},

Second-born children are more risk-taking only with same-gender siblings. In mixed-gender environments, children seem to identify with the gender stereotype that boys are much more willing to take risks than girls, irrespective of birth order.

	abstract = {In the context of childhood development, growth is defined as an irreversible constant increase in size, and development is defined as growth in psychomotor capacity. Both processes are highly dependent on genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors.  Evaluation of growth and development is a crucial element in the physical examination of a patient. Good working knowledge and the skills to evaluate growth and development are necessary for any patient's diagnostic workup. The early recognition of growth or developmental failure helps effective intervention in managing a patient's problem. Stages in Human Growth and Development :  1. Fetal stage: Fetal health issues can have detrimental effects on postnatal growth. One-third of neonates with intrauterine growth retardation might have curtailed postnatal growth. Good perinatal care is essential in promoting fetal health and, indirectly, postnatal growth. 2. Postnatal stage: The postnatal growth and development process happens together but at different rates. The growth occurs by discontinuous saltatory spurts with a stagnant background. There are 5 significant phases in human growth and development, 1. Infancy (neonate and up to 1 year age). 2. Toddler (1 to 5 years of age). 3. Childhood (3 to 11 years old) - early childhood is from 3 to 8 years old, and middle childhood is from 9 to 11 years old. . 4. Adolescence or teenage (from 12 to 18 years old). 5. Adulthood. Factors Affecting Growth and Development  The growth and development are positively influenced by factors like parental health and genetic composition, even before conception. 1. Genetic factors play a primary role in growth and development. The genetic factors influencing height are substantial in the adolescence phase. A large longitudinal cohort study of 7755 Dutch twin pairs has suggested that the additive genetic factors predominantly explained the phenotypic correlations across the ages for height and body mass index. . 2. Fetal health has a highly influential role in achieving growth and development. Any stimulus or insult during fetal development causes developmental adaptations that permanently change the latter part of life. 3. After birth, the environmental factors may exert either a beneficial or detrimental effect on growth. 4. Socioeconomic factors: Children of higher socioeconomic classes are taller than children of the same age and sex in the lower socioeconomic groups. Urbanization has positively influenced growth. The secular trend is observed in growth, where the kids grow taller and mature more rapidly than the previous generation. This secular trend is observed significantly in developed countries like North America. The family characteristics: Higher family education levels have a positive impact on growth. The inadequate emotional support and developmental stimulus, including language training, might cause deterioration in growth and development. . The human-made environment influences human growth and development significantly. Ongoing studies have proven the relationship between pollutants in sexual maturation, obesity, and thyroid function. The excess lead exposure antenatally is significantly associated with low birth weight. Noise pollution due to transportation sources is also associated with reduced prenatal growth. . Nutrition . 1. Malnutrition plays a detrimental role in the process of growth and development. . 2. Deficiencies of trace minerals can affect growth and development. Iron deficiency usually affects psychomotor development and does not affect growth. Zinc deficiency might cause growth retardation and developmental delay. Selenium, iodine, manganese, and copper also play a significant role. . 3. Growth faltering or rapid weight gain in early childhood influences health later in life. The diet in early childhood is strongly associated with the likelihood of obesity later in life. 'Early Protein Hypothesis' shows that lowering the protein supply during infancy helps achieve normal growth and reduce obesity in early childhood. This concept of the early protein hypothesis helps improve children's food products. . 5. Genetic and environmental factors influence the growth and development in a perplexing interrelated pathway. Genetic and environmental risk factors are not mutually exclusive. Plasticity is the potential of a specific genotype to bring out diversified phenotypes in response to diverse environmental factors. The developmental plasticity can happen from embryonic to adolescence and be passed on to the next generation. . 6. Role of experience during early childhood: Exposure to adverse experiences might hinder development. Profound neglect during early childhood can impair development. Children adopted before 6 months of age have similar development when compared to their non-adoptive siblings. If children are adopted after 6 months, they have a high risk of cognition deficits, behavioral issues, autism, and hyperactivity. Early intervention for children with adverse experiences is the pillar of healthy development.},

We characterize the asymptotic behavior of the estimator, propose tools for inference, and develop tests for identifying assumptions. Our method applies with time-varying controls, in triple-difference designs, and with certain non-binary treatments. We show the practical relevance of our results in a simulation study and an application. Studying the consumption response to tax rebates in the United States, we find that the notional marginal propensity to consume is between 8 and 11 percent in the first quarter - about half as large as benchmark estimates used to calibrate macroeconomic models - and predominantly occurs in the first month after the rebate.},

	abstract = {This study presents evidence on the role of social environment for the formation of prosociality. We show that socioeconomic status ({SES}) as well as intensity of mother-child interaction and mothers’ prosocial attitudes are related to elementary school children’s prosociality. We also present evidence on a randomly assigned variation of the social environment, providing children with a mentor for 1 year. Our data reveal a significant and persistent increase in prosociality in the treatment relative to the control group. Moreover, enriching the social environment closes the prosociality gap between low- and high-{SES} children. A mediation analysis suggests that prosociality develops in response to prosocial role models and intense social interactions.},

	abstract = {Preferences for redistribution, as well as the generosity of welfare states, differ significantly across countries. This paper tests whether there exists a feedback process of the economic regime on individual preferences. We exploit the experiment of German separation and reunification to establish exogeneity of the economic system. We find that, after German reunification, East Germans are more in favor of state intervention than West Germans. This effect is especially strong for older cohorts. We further find that East Germans' preferences converge toward those of West Germans. It will take one to two generations for preferences to converge completely. ({JEL} D12, D72, H11, H23, P26)},

	abstract = {Poverty remains one of the most pressing problems facing the world; the mechanisms through which poverty arises and perpetuates itself, however, are not well understood. Here, we examine the evidence for the hypothesis that poverty may have particular psychological consequences that can lead to economic behaviors that make it difficult to escape poverty. The evidence indicates that poverty causes stress and negative affective states which in turn may lead to short-sighted and risk-averse decision-making, possibly by limiting attention and favoring habitual behaviors at the expense of goal-directed ones. Together, these relationships may constitute a feedback loop that contributes to the perpetuation of poverty. We conclude by pointing toward specific gaps in our knowledge and outlining poverty alleviation programs that this mechanism suggests.},

	abstract = {We investigate whether individual experiences of macroeconomic shocks affect financial risk taking, as often suggested for the generation that experienced the Great Depression. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances from 1960 to 2007, we find that individuals who have experienced low stock market returns throughout their lives so far report lower willingness to take financial risk, are less likely to participate in the stock market, invest a lower fraction of their liquid assets in stocks if they participate, and are more pessimistic about future stock returns. Those who have experienced low bond returns are less likely to own bonds. Results are estimated controlling for age, year effects, and household characteristics. More recent return experiences have stronger effects, particularly on younger people.},
