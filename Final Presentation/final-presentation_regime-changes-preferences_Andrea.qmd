Research question: Is there a causal link between experiencing regime changes and different

# Data

Economic preferences: patience, risk taking, positive reciprocity, negative reciprocity, altruism, trust

|  |  |
|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| V-Dem | General Preference Survey |
| Panel from 1789-now | Cross-section collected in 2012 |
| Liberal Democracy Index ( 0 - 1 ) | 6 economic preferences, country, age, math skills, gender |

-   Combination of both: approx 75.000 individuals from 1910-2012 from 76 countries

-   Economic preferences are formed during childhood + adolescence (Detlefsen et al., 2024)

## Economic preferences

Note: přidej všechny preferences, jak byly měřeny a scale

# Setting

## Treatment group

-   Initial approach: Regime change experienced between 3 -18 years old (democratization / autocratization)
    -   Goal: identify whether an individual experienced a regime change during formative years (3-18)
        -   According to Lührmann et al. (2020): Evaluating differences of the LDI index at time **t** and **t-10** -\> **confidence intervals** -\>**no overlap** between them **AND** absolute value of the change in LDI is \> 0.05 **=** identified as regime change
        -   Was individual's age between 3-18 during this identified year -\> treated
-   **New approach**: democratization / autocratization as a treatment

Note: Přidej graf regime changes na urovni zemi

## Control group

Note: přidej tabulku pocty pozorovani v jednotlivych skupinach + rozdeleni zemi

# Econometric models

## Baseline specification

$$
Y_{ict} = \alpha + \beta \cdot \text{Autocratization}_{ic} + \gamma_c + \delta_t  + \varepsilon_{ict}
$$

$$
Y_{ict} = \alpha + \beta \cdot \text{Democratization}_{ic} + \gamma_c + \delta_t  + \varepsilon_{ict}
$$ Where:

$Y_{ict}$: **Preference outcome** (trust, patience, etc.) for **individual** ( i ), **country** ( c ), **birth cohort** ( t )

$\text{Autocratization}_{ic}$ or $\text{Democratization}_{ic}$ : Binary treatments indicator (1 if experienced democratization or autocratization during formative years, 0 otherwise)

$\gamma_c$ : Country fixed effects

$\delta_t$ : Birth cohort fixed effects

$X_{ict}$ : Controls including:

Average V-Dem LDI during formative years (ages 3-18)

Average GDP in formative years

Recession experience

$\beta$ : Causal effect of interest

-   Goal: Exploit cross-sectional variation between individuals who experienced regime changes and those who didn't, within the same country and birth cohort, while controlling for observed characteristics
